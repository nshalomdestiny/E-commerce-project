### E-Commerce Project

This is a personal project aimed at developing skills in working with microservices architecture. This project implements a microservices architecture for an e-commerce platform. The system is designed to handle various functionalities, including product catalog, shopping cart, order processing, user management, payment processing, notifications, reviews, and shipping.

### Microservices Breakdown

2. **Shopping Cart Service:**
    Creates and manages shopping carts for users.
    Allows users to add, remove, and modify items in their carts.
    Calculates cart totals and applies discounts.
    Communicates with the Product Catalog Service to retrieve product information.

3. **Order Processing Service:**
    Processes orders placed by users.
    Verifies payment information.
